# Introduction

Welcome to Design Systems With React! Design systems have been a passion of mine for the last couple of years so I'm thrilled to teach you this course.

This course will introduce many skills, some of which may be new and some of which you may have prior experience with. I will cover the pieces of each technology you need to know to complete this course, but this course will not be an in-depth tutorial for any one technology.

We will be coding in React, so it's recommended you have React knowledge prior to taking this course, but the rest of the skills we'll learn don't require prior experience.

Some of the topics and technologies we'll cover include:

- [Foundations of design systems]('foundations-of-design-systems.md')
- Foundations of design (i.e. color theory, typography)
- Design prototyping tools (Figma)
- Creating extensible React components with styled components
- Animating components with React Spring
- Testing components with Jest & Enzyme
- Documenting components with Storybook
- Publishing your component library to NPM

There are a few things you should have prior to taking this course:

You should create an account on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This is where we'll be designing our color palette, typography, and components.

You should also sign up for an [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) account. We'll be using NPM to publish our components to the registry so they can be installed and used in other projects.

## What This Course Is

This course is a high-level introduction to design systems. It will teach you the foundational skills your team needs to build a set of reusable components and standards.

## What This Course Is Not

This course is not a comprehensive overview to design systems. There is no industry-standard for what a design system truly is, and as a result it can be interpreted differently at different companies.
